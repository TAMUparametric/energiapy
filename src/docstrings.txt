    Examples:

        [1] A resource that can be consumed is declared by setting a consume 

        >>> Solar = Resource(name='Solar', consume= 100)

        [2] A resource that can be purchase need a price to be set, besides consume.

        >>> Water = Resource(name='H2O', consume= 100, purchase_cost= 20)

        [3] If the resource can be discharged.

        >>> CO2 = Resource(name='CO2', discharge = True)

        [4] If the resource can be sold. A selling price is set along with sell = True.

        >>> Power = Resource(name='Power', discharge = True, sell_cost = 0.2)

        [5] Additional attributes can be added. Note that this resource is only used implicitly in the system. 

        >>> H2 = Resource(name='H2', basis = 'tons', label = 'Hydrogen', block= 'DEC', citation = 'Kakodkar, et. al (2024)')

        [6] A storage resource can be declared here. Or a resource can be given to a storage type Process which generates a stored resource

        >>> Money= Resource(name='Poishe', basis = 'Rupees', store_max= 2, store_min = 0, store_loss = 0.01)

        [7] Uncertainty in resource parameters for selling price, availability, and purchase price can be handled by either:

        1. Providing deterministic dataset for variablity at the Location level 

        OR through:

        2. Multiparameteric programming (mpP). To declare a parameteric variable, either give ranges for data (as tuples )instead of floats
        or insert energiapy.Theta(bounds = (_, _)) in place of the parameter.

        For example, if the availability of water is uncertain:

        >>>  H2 = Resource(name='H2', discharge = True, sell_cost = (0, 10)) 

        or 

        >>> H2 = Resource(name='H2', discharge = True, sell_cost = Theta(bounds = (0, 10)))

        Multiple parameters of a resource can also be uncertain. As shown here, where water has both uncertain availability as well as price.

        >>> Water = Resource(name='H2O', consume= Theta((0, 45)), purchase_cost= Theta((0, 3))) 

        [8] Environmental impact potentials can also be declared for resources

        >>> NaturalGas = Resource(name = 'NG', consume = 1000, gwp = 30, odp = 50, acid = 20, eutt = 5, eutf = 60, eutm = 10)

        incidental_factor (Dict[Tuple[Location, Location], Dict[Transport, DataFrame]], optional):  Factor for varying incidental expenditure for Transport between Locations. Defaults to None.
        basis (str, optional): unit in which land area is measured. Defaults to None.
        label (str, optional): used while generating plots. Defaults to None.
        citation (str, optional): can provide citations for your data sources. Defaults to None.
        ctype (List[NetworkType], optional): Network type type. Defaults to None.
        aspect (Dict[NetworkParamType, ParameterType], optional): paramater type of declared values. Defaults to None.
        ftype (Dict[NetworkParamType, FactorType], optional): factor type of declared factors. Defaults to None.
        factors (Dict[LocationParamType, Factor], optional): collection of factors defined at Network. Defaults to None.

    Examples:

        Networks object with to and from movement of resources using Transport. In the following example, Train and Pipeline can be set up from 'Goa' to 'Texas'

        >>> Move = Network(name= 'Network', sources= [Goa, Texas], sinks= [Texas, Goa], distance_matrix= [[0, 500],[500, 0]], transport_matrix= [[], [Train, Pipe]], [[Train, Pipe], []]], label = 'network for moving stuff')

        Networks can also have one way movement of resources. In the following example, a Pipeline is set up from Goa to Texas.

        >>> BrainDrain = Network(name= 'BrainDrain', sources= [Goa], sinks= [Texas], distance_matrix= [[0, 500],[500, 0]], transport_matrix= [[], [Pipe]], [[], []]], label = 'The Pipeline') )

        Declaring distance matrix:
        Consider a source (Goa), and two sinks (Texas, Macedonia) at a distance of 1000 and 500 units. The source will form the rows and sinks the columns.
        The distance matrix will look something like this:

        >>> distance_matrix = [[1000, 500]]

        Declaring transport matrix:
        Similarly say, there is a ship (Ship) avaiable between only Goa and Macedonia, and a flight (Plane) available from Goa to both regions.
        The transport matrix can be stated as:

        >>> transport_matrix = [[[Ship], [Ship, Plane]]]
