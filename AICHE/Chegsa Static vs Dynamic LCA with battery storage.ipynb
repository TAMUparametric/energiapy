    "The following case study considers three different type of solar photovoltaics, namely Monocrystalline (PV_Mo), Polycrystalline (PV_Po), and Cadmium Telluride (PV_Cd) and  Lithium-ion batteries made of either rock-based lithium (LiI_Ro) or brine-based lithium (LiI_Br).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to meet a fixed demand of hydrogen on a daily scale while optimizing the production process by using forecasting techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that three different hydrogen pathways can be utilized each with their respective emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis: By using real-time carbon accounting, decisions and changes can be made in a more dynamic nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users are advised caution in terms of assigning the emissions at the appropriate levels and avoiding double account. For example, if providing the global warming potentials (GWP) for each individual material to make up a process, the GWP for processes should only consider the values for construction. Moreover, the direct emissions are considered through the resource balance constraint."
