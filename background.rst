Background and Theory
=====================

For an overview on the state-of-the-art in energy systems modeling and optimization 
including key challenges and opportunities see :footcite:`kakodkar2022review`. 
To understand the mathematical programming implementation, the resource task network (RTN)
methodology :footcite:`barbosa_povoa_pantelides_1997` is a great starting point. 
Energia's :ref:`publication_history` is indicative of key capabilities and applicative 
domains. For more research on advancing computational methods in modeling and optimization
see `Multiparameteric Optimization and Control (Pistikopoulos) Group <https://parametric.tamu.edu>`_. 


Direct any queries regarding the implementation or theoretical background to Rahul Kakodkar (cacodcar@gmail.com).

   for Multiscale Modeling and Optimization which serves as the backend.
